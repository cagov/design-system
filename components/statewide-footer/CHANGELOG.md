# CHANGELOG for ds-statewide-footer
`ds-statewide-footer`
# 1.0.3
* Updated statewide footer container's padding to 16px instead of 1rem to make it consistent with other components.
# 1.0.2
* Changed space between ca.gov icon and first link to 24px. Made distance from the footer's top to the ca.gov logo 16px in mobile.
# 1.0.1
* Updated ca.gov logo to have cagov colors, not the colors of the department/agency. Removed link from the ca.gov icon since there is actual spelled out link to the ca.gov website next to it.
