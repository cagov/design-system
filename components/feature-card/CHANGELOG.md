# Feature card changelog

## 1.0.7
* Updated color variables and changed button class to btn-primary

## 1.0.6
* Remove loading="lazy" attribute from main image because it is usually above the fold and should not have any display delays
* Use an H1 instead of h2 in the sample markup because the feature card usually holds the most important page header

## 1.0.5
* Limit the h3 definition to .cagov-featured-section, so it doesn't reset all h3 across the site.

## 1.0.4
* Linted and formatted code per root eslint/prettier settings.
* Added unit test.

## 1.0.3
* Added CHANGELOG file and added src folder with index.scss file to be consistent with the rest of the components.
