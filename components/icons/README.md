# Icons

Icons are visual cues that help people find key information and common actions. They visually represent:

- An idea or thing
- What something does
- How someone can interact with it

Icons reduce cognitive load by communicating meanings or actions simply and accurately.

## When and how to use it

Use icons as visual indicators to make key actions or information easy to find. [Organize content strategically](https://hub.innovation.ca.gov/content-design/principles/organize-content-strategically/) before using icons. Choose an existing icon from [Version 5.6.2 of the CAGov icon library](#icon-library) whenever possible.

Use icons for the same purpose consistently to avoid confusion for visitors and reduce cognitive load. Select an icon thatâ€™s as closely tied to the specific information or action as possible. When it may not be clear what the icon means, pair it with a label or supporting text.

The Design System uses a standard set of icons for common actions. Several components incorporate icons automatically. This ensures consistency, and fewer steps for content designers. Some examples include:

- Expand icon in the [accordion](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/components/accordion/readme/)
- Hamburger icon in the [site navigation](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/components/site-navigation/readme/) menu for mobile devices
- External and pdf link icons in the [link icon](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/components/link-icon/readme/)
- Social media icons in the [site footer](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/components/site-footer/readme/)
- Up arrow icon in the [back to top button](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/components/back-to-top/readme/)

For a [page alert](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/components/page-alert/readme/), choose an icon that supports the tone of the alert.

### How not to use it

Do not use an icon:

- That does not relate to the meaning or action
- Without a label if it is not widely understood
- For more than one function or concept
- Where an image or graphic is more appropriate
- For decoration
- If it creates visual clutter (like using too many on a page)
- As a shortcut to guide visitors to important information without structuring content strategically

## Project installation

### Method 1

#### Minimal sprite and JavaScript

Recommended for projects that use 10 - 200 icons.

The instructions assume familiarity with [npm](https://npmjs.com) package management tool, modern JavaScript techniques, and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

1. Identify all the icons you will need for your project by id using the <a href="#icon-library">Icon library</a> below.

2. `npm install @cagov/ds-icons`

3. Run the command `npm run dev:sprite-some [ids]` to generate a the sprite

   - Example: `npm run dev:sprite-some gear arrow-down left`

4. The generated sprite will be called `cagovSomeIcons.svg`.

5. Include the generated sprite and ./index.js as a module in your project or page.

6. Place individual icon inline with `<cagov-icon data-icon="[id]"></cagov-icon>`

### Demo and sample markup

<html-preview>

```html preview
<div
  style="display:grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-gap: 20px; text-align: center;"
>
  <!--Decorative-->
  <cagov-icon data-icon="arrow-down"></cagov-icon>
  <cagov-icon data-icon="drive"></cagov-icon>
  <!--Functional-->
  <cagov-icon data-icon="gear" data-sr="Settings"></cagov-icon>
  <cagov-icon data-icon="left" data-sr="Next Page"></cagov-icon>
</div>
```

</html-preview>

### Method 2

#### Direct download and include.

Recommended for projects that use 1-9 icons.

1. Identify the icon(s) you will need for your project by id using the <a href="#icon-library">Icon library</a> below.

2. Click the Download link.

3. Copy/paste or reference the icon in your project.

### Method 3

#### Icon font and CSS.

Recommended for projects where content authors need to be able to add any font inline using only HTML.

2. Copy the `src/fonts` folder to your web app.

3. Copy the `src/icon-font.css` file to your web app.

4. Include the CSS in your project or page. The CSS must be at the same directory level as the `fonts` folder.

5. Place individual icon in HTML using `<span class="ca-gov-icon-[id]" aria-hidden="true"></span>`

### Demo and sample markup

<html-preview>

```html preview
<span class="ca-gov-icon-audio" aria-hidden="true"></span>
<span class="ca-gov-icon-drive" aria-hidden="true"></span>
<span class="ca-gov-icon-ferry" aria-hidden="true"></span>
<span class="ca-gov-icon-van" aria-hidden="true"></span>
```

</html-preview>

<!-- If the title is simply `Accessibility`, the display of the accessibility icon breaks. -->

## Accessibility recommendations

### Component-specific accessibility review

These icons are decorative by default and use the `aria-hidden` attribute. Associated text can be made available to screen readers using [Method 1](#method-1) and the attribute pattern `data-sr="My descriptive text."` When using Methods 2 and 3, be mindful of accessibility best practices.

### Standard accessibility review

As a component in Alpha status, this component must pass the following accessibility reviews every time a new version is published:

- Tested with the [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) accessibility tool and passes all automated [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) Level AA checks
- Reviewed with the [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1121.html) screen reader on desktop
- Verified keyboard navigation and that all actionable elements of the component are reachable via keyboard commands only
- Reviewed component layout on a variety of screen sizes
