      <h2>What design systems do</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="cagov-section-highlight">Design systems collect knowledge and solutions to problems teams confront over and over again. They combine UX rules, interface components, and code. Teams work faster, design better, and focus on new problems instead of old ones.</p>
      <div class="cagov-cluster-3">
        <span>
          <p class="cagov-bold">Cohesive & consistent user experiences</p>
          <p>Services and products that use the design system feel the same, even when they have their own identity. This puts the focus on what Californians need to do.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <p class="cagov-bold">Accessibility and performance</p>
          <p>All design system components meet WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards. Our components take accessibility further by incorporating high performance so they work well across a range of devices and internet speeds.</p>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="cagov-cluster-3">
        <span>
          <p class="cagov-bold">Tested solutions</p>
          <p>We test components before releasing them. This lets departments deploy them with confidence without having to do their own testing.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <p class="cagov-bold">Shared vocabulary</p>
          <p>A common language for components, patterns, and conventions eases collaboration within and across teams.</p>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="cagov-cluster-3">
        <span>
          <p class="cagov-bold">Leverage best practices across California</p>
          <p>The design system captures tried-and-true best practices and allows other teams to use them. As new best practices emerge, the design system absorbs them, upgrading all products.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <p class="cagov-bold">Effective use of resources</p>
          <p>With common problems already solved, designers and developers can speed through the basics, doing more with less time and budget.</p>
